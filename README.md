# What to do with your Toaster?

This started as a fun application to inform some colleagues that they shouldn't throw away their Windows PC. A fresh install can be sufficient and often even work wonders. If you add a little boost here and there in the form of an SSD, the PC might not need to be discarded at all. Currently, some are already dealing with the end-of-life of Windows 10 in October 2025 and the question of how much electronic waste will be generated. For a better feeling, I have now packaged a wealth of information and system checks into an app (hosted in a WebView2/Chromium control) that analyzes the system and provides tips and hints regarding its health status. **This might help prevent someone from throwing away their PC and instead consider other uses for it.**

The tool essentially employs Chromium as the frontend and utilizes C# in the backend. Perhaps, this could even be the foundation for something more significant â€“ a tool for efficiently and straightforwardly assessing the system's health. It aims to present information to the average user in understandable language.
